          The squared area above is a place for a partner's
          advertising banner managed by a "3rd party code" loaded as a
          secure Plugin created with
          the <a href="https://github.com/asvd/jailed">Jailed</a>
          library. The Plugin runs in a sandboxed Worker and cannot
          access the main document, with except for the two methods
          explicitily exported by the application: for changing the
          url the banner is pointing to, and for changing the banner
          image. Even if the Plugin performs an attempt to set too big
          image, it will be cropped by the application. The Plugin is
          fully controlled by the application and may be connected or
          disconnected anytime (operated with the two buttons in this
          demo).
