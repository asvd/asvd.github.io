          This is a demo for
          the <a href='https://gist.github.com/asvd/415db1212e299205aa0c'>
          RPC for the jailed JavaScript</a>.

          <br/><br/>

          The squared area above is a place for a partner's
          advertising banner managed by a "3rd party code" loaded as a
          restricted plugin. The potentially insecure code runs in a
          Worker and cannot access the main document, with except for
          the two methods explicitily exported by the application: for
          changing the url the banner is pointing to, and for changing
          the banner image. Even if the Plugin performs an attempt to
          set too big image, it will be cropped by the application.
